# ROS2 Course Graph Visualization

This application visualizes a network (graph) of ROS2 courses, modules, and their relationships. It uses **Vue 3**, **D3.js**, and **Vite** for a fast, modern development experience.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm:**  
  Ensure you have a recent version of Node.js installed. You can check by running:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v

## How to Run the application

```bash
git clone https://github.com/The-CloudCoder/vue-graph-app.git
cd vue-graph-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

By default, Vite will start the app on http://localhost:5173/.
